# Robot_EVE-Ruphus-project-Emb_AI
LEGO Mindstorm project for Embodied AI class. The main task of the robot is to climb the ramp following the ramp and retreat the object back from the second level of the ramp.

## Sensors used:
1) Right color sensor for line detection
2) Left color sensor for line detection

## TO DO:
1) Implement code for line following✅
2) Test on the track✅  
3) Submit the 1 check in by Thursday✅
4) Add sensor for object detection and to measure how far the object is
5) Play with algorithm working together

## The process:
1. Line following task is compleatedusing the PID technique. During the developing fase it was deided to switch from 1 color sensor to 2 for stability and more smooth line following. The design of the RobotEVE/Ruphus also was changed, cause the position of sensors was stopping him from climbing up the ramp.
